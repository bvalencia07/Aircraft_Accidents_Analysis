## Overview

For this project, the company that I respond to is expanding into new industries to expand their portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft.

## Business Problem

Figure out what aircrafts impose the least amount of risk for both commercial and private use. Charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. Must then translate findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

## Data Preparation 

This project will consist of working with the Aviation Dataset that consists of a spreadsheet containing information on aircraft accidents over the last few decades. Which includes aircraft make and model, number of fatalities, weather conditions, and more.

## Results

Upon examining the dataset, one is able to notice that single engine aircrafts and reciprocating engine types have the highest number of reported accidents within the dataset. While aiplanes with two engines and that ran on turbo fans appeared to be the safest. With that knowledge in mind, one is able to further find that airplanes that come from the Boeing brand seem to be the most reappearing airplanes that reported back zero serious injuries

## Conclusion

In conclusion, the stakeholders should avoid single engine reciprocating aircrafts as those are considered to have the highest risk and should turn to turbo fan aircrafts with two engines, specifically those manufactured by Boeing as those would be the lowest risk. That being said, I would recommend the Boeing 737 and Boeing 777 for commercial use, and the Learjet 35 for private use.
