# Overview

For this project, the company that I respond to is expanding into new industries to expand their portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft.

# Business Problem

Figure out what aircrafts impose the least amount of risk for both commercial and private use. Charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. Must then translate findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

# Data Preparation 

This project will consist of working with the Aviation Dataset that consists of a spreadsheet containing information on aircraft accidents over the last few decades. Which includes aircraft make and model, number of fatalities, weather conditions, and more.
